Quick start

Use composer to get the latest version
```
composer require webdevvie/shortner-php-client
```

Then make a connection
```php
<?php
//change this to the site you would like to use
$shortnerHostname = 'www.testo.local';
//your api key obtainable from the site running shortner.
$shortnerApiKey = 'testkey';

$client = new \Shortner\ApiClient($shortnerHostname,$shortnerApiKey);

$newLink = new \Shortner\API\NewLink();
$newLink->setUrl('http://www.johnbakker.name');
$shortLink = $client->createLink($newLink);
echo $shortLink->getLink()->getUrl();
```

Of course there are quite a few properties of info you can get.
